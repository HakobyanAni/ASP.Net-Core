<h3><b> What is Web API? </b></h3>
Before we understand what is Web API, let's see what is an <b>API (Application Programing Interface)</b>. In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building software and applications. To put it in simple terms, API is some kind of interface which has a set of functions that allow programmers to access specific features or data of an application, operating system or other services. Web API as the name suggests, is an API over the web which can be accessed using HTTP protocol. It is a concept and not a technology. We can build Web API using different technologies such as Java, .NET etc. 
The **ASP.NET Core Web API** is an extensible framework for building HTTP based services that can be accessed in different applications on different platforms such as web, windows, mobile etc.
